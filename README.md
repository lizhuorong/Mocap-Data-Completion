# Mocap-Data-Completion
(1) we utilize motion database to span two expressive spaces, namely, the frame space and trajectory space, to successfully process the new-come motion;

(2) improve the linear interpolation techniques applied to the gaps filling problem via a coordinate transformation, which depends on the pairwise training samples;

(3) utilize the high covariance both between frame coordinates and between marker coordinates to recover the missing data from the information provided by the available frames and markers respectively.
